**Carabiner** is a simple, lightweight, and easy-to-use video capture and remote control simulator app that supports Roku and Android based streaming devices (FireTV, AndroidTV and Google TV). It floats on top of other apps, so you can easily control your WCTV app while visualizes it on your computer.

It is perfect for developers and QA engineers to execute and test applications using a capture card and the computer keyboard, without the need of a TV set or a Remote control.

## Features

**Carabiner** features a wide range of settings for:

- Changing the dimensions of the floating window
- Changing the transparency of the floating window
- Adding a border to the window
- Create a list of streaming devices to connect and control
- Configure the path to the ADB executable
- Overlay a picture to check "design vs app screen" for pixel perfect UI
- Configurable global shortcut to show/hide the floating window
- Option to show/hide the settings window on app start
- Option to launch the app on system login
- Option to enable/disable the always on top for the floating window

### Future Improvements

- Freely resizable floating window including fullscreen support
- Configure a shortcut to save a screenshot of the floating window
- Allow user to record captured video to mp4/mkv file
- Detect the list streaming devices in the network (SSDP)
- Link capture devices with streaming devices
- Add missing ADB keyboard mapping

## Installation

**Carabiner** is available on macOS and Windows (Linux will be available soon). You can download the installers from the [releases](https://github.com/lvcabral/carabiner/releases) page.

### Pre-requisites

1. First time you run the app, you will need to authorize the app to have access to your camera and microphone.
2. Make sure your Roku devices have the Developer Mode enabled, see the documentation [here](https://developer.roku.com/docs/developer-program/getting-started/developer-setup.md).
3. Make sure your Fire TV and Google TV devices have the ADB Debugging enabled, see the documentation [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb).
4. To control Fire TV and Google TV, make sure your computer has the ADB executable installed and you configured the path in the settings. Get the latest version of the platform tools [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools.html).
5. First time you connect to your Fire TV or Google TV device, you will need to authorize the connection.

> **Note:** Carabiner is a prototype at this point. If you find any bugs, [please raise an issue](https://github.com/lvcabral/carabiner/issues/new). Also, we don't have a code signing certificate yet, so you might have to allow the app to run on your system.

## Usage

After installing Carabiner, launch the application and customize the settings to your preferences. Once you have configured the settings, you can minimize or close the settings window and start using the floating window.

### Controlling Streaming Devices

1. **Select a Capture Device**: In the `Display` tab, select a video capture device from the list.
2. **Select a Streaming Device**: In the `Control` tab, select a streaming device from the list.
3. **Keyboard Controls**: When the floating display window is focused, you can use your keyboard to control the selected device. Refer to the [keyboard control mappings](./docs/key-mappings.md) documentation to learn how to operate your device.

### Overlay Image

You can load an overlay image on top of the video capture to help you compare a screen design with the app. This feature is useful for achieving pixel-perfect UI designs.

### Additional Features

- **Transparency**: Adjust the transparency of the floating window.
- **Dimensions**: Change the dimensions of the floating window.
- **Borders**: Add or customize the border of the floating window.
