**Carabiner** is a simple, lightweight, and easy-to-use video capture and remote control simulator app that supports Roku and Android based streaming devices (FireTV, AndroidTV and Google TV). It floats on top of other apps, so you can easily control your WCTV app while visualizes it on your computer.

It is perfect for developers and QA engineers to execute and test applications using a capture card and the computer keyboard, without the need of a TV set or a Remote control.
